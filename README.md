**Local Government Area (LGA) Summary**

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

## Observations
### The first observation I noticed from observing the data, is that just because the spending per student may be higher than other school, does not necessarily mean that this leads to better maths and reading scores. In fact, the average overall percentage of passing scores came from the two lower spending ranges per student.
---

### The second observation I noticed was that the lower the school size, the better the overall passing of both maths and reading.
---

### The final observation was that Independent schools not only have a higher overall passing percentage, but they also scored higher on average maths scores, average reading scores, percentage passing maths and percentage passing reading.
