#Assignment 4- PyCity Schools
## Challenge: draw three correct conclusions from the data for Pymoli

##The first observation I noticed from observing the data, is that just because the spending per student may be higher than other school, does not necessarily mean that this leads to better maths and reading scores. In fact, the average overall percentage of passing scores came from the two lower spending ranges per student.

##The second observation I noticed was that the lower the school size, the better the overall passing of both maths and reading.

##The final observation was that Independent schools not only have a higher overall passing percentage, but they also scored higher on average maths scores, average reading scores, percentage passing maths and percentage passing reading.
